# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-0001: Template Rails Established

**Date**: 2024-08-28
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
The template lacked persistent artifacts to guide development decisions and maintain consistency across different developers and AI agents working on the codebase.

### Decision
Add four core documentation files as rails for the project:
- PRD.md for product requirements
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for structural conventions
- WORKFLOW.md for development process
- ADR.md for architectural decisions

### Alternatives Considered
1. Rely solely on README.md and CLAUDE.md
2. Use external documentation tools
3. Embed conventions in code comments

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Future agents and developers have stable rails to follow
- Consistent development patterns across the codebase
- Clear decision history for architectural choices
- Reduced onboarding time for new contributors

**Negative:**
- Additional documentation to maintain
- Requires discipline to update consistently

### Implementation
Files created at repository root with templates and current state documentation.
